And if we truly want to understand our purpose we must know it all starts with God. It’s not about you; it’s not about me; it’s not about this person or that person. Our purpose is far greater than ourselves and starts with understanding the author of it all. Lean into this series as we rediscover what it is like to live purpose-driven lives in light of being made by God and for God and with a grand and fulfilling purpose!",

Those walks give me the chance to reflect on the day that’s passed or to think about the day that’s coming, or just to switch off. They are genuinely one of the highlights of my day.",
